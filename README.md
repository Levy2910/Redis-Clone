# Redis Clone (Java Learning Project)

This project is a simplified clone of Redis, built in Java as part of a 1-month learning challenge.  
The goal is to understand how Redis works under the hood by incrementally building its core features.

## ✅ Current Progress

**Day 1 & 2: Java Collections & Basic Store**
- Implemented a simple in-memory key-value store using `HashMap<String, String>`.
- Supported operations: `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`.
