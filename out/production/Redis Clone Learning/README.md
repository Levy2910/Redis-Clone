# Redis Clone (Java Learning Project)

This project is a simplified clone of Redis, built in Java as part of a 1-month learning challenge.  
The goal is to understand how Redis works under the hood by incrementally building its core features.

## Current Progress

**Day 1 & 2: Java Collections & Basic Store**
- Implemented a simple in-memory key-value store using `HashMap<String, String>`.
- Supported operations: `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`.

## Learning Timeline

| Day | Topic |
|-----|-------|
| Day 1 | Java Collections: Intro to `HashMap`, basic methods |
| Day 2 | Java Input/OutputStream: Use InputStream, OutPut stream to read, write files (will apply the same concept for Redis) |

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Levy2910/Redis-Clone.git
   cd Redis-Clone
